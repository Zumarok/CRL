CRL Notes 8/12
- Load new level on victory.


- Reward System


------

PoE like map system, ex: t1-25(?) (maps?) selected via a tower like layout. Can use gold(?) to roll and reroll mods onto the encounter for better chance at rewards and added difficulty. Elite/Boss encounters can appear randomly(?) and can drop keys for endgame fights.

Fights can have multiple waves, with a boss at the end.

Card system similar to Minion Masters, ex: when you get a card it is now in your collection and you can add it to your deck. (? Deck consists of 10 cards w/ 2 wildcards(?))

When a card drops you can choose to :
 (a) collect the card and add it to your collection
 (b) sacrifice the card and apply the xp to an existing copy
 (c) sell the card for gold



Classes (4?)

Skill area on the tree for each class

Sub class at level 25(?)

item slots ex: rings trinkets, to limit the number of equipped items.

Inventory system.
